# Traffic_Simulation
Developed a motion of a car in response to traffic lights Using OpenGL. We have three lights in the signal Red, Green and Yellow. Each light has some meaning . Red means stop , Green means go, Yellow means ready to go.

As we know, the traffic signals direct the flow of traffic with the exemption of signals with turning arrows which should be compulsory in accord with each other.Traffic signals help us to drive our vehicles in a safer manner lowering the risk of accidents, if properly followed.

Same method we implemented in our project which was used in real life .We have used this traffic signal in a cross road to avoid mishappening. When there is a green signal it means the vehicle can move or run on the road but if this green signal turns off and the red signal is turned on then it indicates the driver to stop his vehicle and at the same time signal allows some other side vehicle to cross the road. But if the vehicle is in the middle of a cross or vehicle has crossed the signal then there is no meaning of red light for the driver. When we press left mouse click then red light will glow and all vehicles are stopped and when we press and hold right mouse click then yellow light will glow and all vehicles ready to go .When we release the right mouse click then green light will glow and then the vehicle starts moving.

## METHODOLOGY

### ALGORITHM:

  ➔ Line drawing algorithm for traffic light pole and body of the car.
  
  ➔ Circle drawing algorithm for wheels of the car and lights of the traffic pole.
  
  ➔ Flood fill algorithm for colouring.

### LANGUAGE:

  ➔ C++ using OpenGL API for graphics

### TOOLS USED: CodeBlocks
● It can create native Win32 executables, either console or GUI, as well as DLLs and static
libraries.

● The application is platform independent.

● C++ was chosen to code the project as it is the most commonly used language in conjunction with OpenGL.
